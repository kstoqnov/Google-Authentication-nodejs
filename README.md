passport-google-oauth20
```
Install Dependencies by write the below code in your terminal
```javascript
npm i ejs connect-mongo dotenv express-session mongoose passport passport-google-oauth20

```javascript
npm i -D nodemon
```
Setup application for developer run and normal run. Just change the Script section with the below code in package.json.
```
"scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "dev": "nodemon app.js"
  },
```
## Start local server

```javascript
npm run dev
```

#### The main work is start from there

You need to just put your google client id and secret in this file. And also the mongodb uri like(`mongodb://localhost:27017/`) if you are hosting mongodb from your system . if you are using [Mongodb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/) it like(`mongodb+srv://XXXX:XXXX@cluster0.obaan.mongodb.net/{DBNAME}?retryWrites=true&w=majority`)

file:`config/config.env`

```
PORT = 3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://XXXX:XXXX@cluster0.obaan.mongodb.net/{DBNAME}?retryWrites=true&w=majority
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = XXXXXXXXXX
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
